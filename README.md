# Mitosis Coding Styleguide

Contained within is a collection of style rules and suggestions for markup and code used on Mitosis and Meiosis projects, including HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript and its frameworks, PHP, et al, with the end goal being maintainability, readability and consistency of code between all Mitosis and Meiosis projects and among all developers working on various projects.

## Outline, Goals

At time of writing, little conceptualization has been done on this, so this section will serve as an outline of what we would like to include. This section and this paragraph will be revised as more is added. The first iterations of this project will outline general goals for each subsection, and as sections are added or removed, this README will be updated.
